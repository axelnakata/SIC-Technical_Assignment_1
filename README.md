# SIC-Technical_Assignment_1
 This repository contains an IoT project implemented using an ESP32 microcontroller, Python Flask for the server-side application, and HTML for the user interface. The project aims to collect temperature data from a sensor connected to the ESP32, send it to a local server using HTTP POST requests, and display the data in real-time on a web dashboard.
